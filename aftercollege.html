    <h1>College Finance:</h1>
    <h2>Renting/Buying Houses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your rent/mortgage should never be more than 25% of your monthly income</li>  
      </ul>
    <h2>Car Buying</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cars begin to lose value the moment you drive them off the lot. To avoid losing massive amounts of money buy a lightly used car in cash.</li>  
        <li>Used cars won't lose value as quickly as new cars and are often much cheaper. </li>  
      </ul>
    <h2>Retirement</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>15% of your monthly income should be put into a retirement fund. This will make sure that you have enough money for your retirement.</li>  
      </ul>
    <h2>Emergency Fund</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You should have a account with your bank that has 3-6 months worth of monthly expenses in case of an emergency.</li>  
        <li>If you have a commission based job like a real estate miracle then you should have closer to 6 months of expenses for financial security.</li>
      </ul>
