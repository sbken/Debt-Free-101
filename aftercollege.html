    <h1>College Finance:</h1>
    <h2>Renting/Buying Houses</h2>
   <p>•Your rent/mortgage should never be more than 25% of your monthly income</p>  
      
     
    <h2>Car Buying</h2>
  <p>•Cars begin to lose value the moment you drive them off the lot. To avoid losing massive amounts of money buy a lightly used car in cash.</p>  
        <p>•Used cars won't lose value as quickly as new cars and are often much cheaper. </p>  
  
    <h2>Retirement</h2>
  <p>•15% of your monthly income should be put into a retirement fund. This will make sure that you have enough money for your retirement.</p>  
    
     
    <h2>Emergency Fund</h2>
   <p>•You should have a account with your bank that has 3-6 months worth of monthly expenses in case of an emergency.</p>  
        <p>•If you have a commission based job like a real estate miracle then you should have closer to 6 months of expenses for financial security.</p>
